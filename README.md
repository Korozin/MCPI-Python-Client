# MCPI-Python-Client
A python client I'm sharing made by FGS
These clients are made by other people and I am SHARING them for other people to use. For Morpheus.py to run you need python3 and pip. To import the modules go into the directory you unzipped it in and type "sudo pip3 install keyboard pysimplegui mcpi" for the modules, then type "sudo python3 Morpheus.py" to run
