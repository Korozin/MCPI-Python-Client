# MCPI-Python-Client
A python client I'm sharing made by FGS
These clients are made by other people and I am SHARING them for other people to use. For Morpheus.py to run you need python3 and pip. To import the modules go into the directory you unzipped it in and type "sudo pip3 install keyboard pysimplegui mcpi" for the modules, then type "sudo python3 Morpheus.py" to run


For the second client this one should be a bit easier, just open terminal in the unzipped folder directory then type in "python app.py" and a GUI should appear. If it doesn't work you can always run the sub scirpts alone.
